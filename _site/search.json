    "text": "I’m Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I teach and research at the intersection of housing policy, neighborhood change, and social equity in cities.\nMy research uses housing and residential mobility as a way to explore a range of deeper questions about our cities including health, equity, and governance of change. As an urban planner, I use a range of methods - both qualitative and quantitative - to explore these issues, oftentimes in partnership with community partners, institutional stakeholders, and researchers from other disciplines. My goal is to tell vivid stories about cities that have the power to transform how we plan and who we plan for.\nI became a housing policy researcher due in part to my experience growing up in Chicago. Growing up, I observed the ways in which housing contributed to segregation and uneven development. I became an urban planner with the goal of addressing these types of issues, and focused my practice on housing and community development. I chose to become an academic researcher in order to bring new perspective and influence to our understanding of housing and neighborhoods.\nAs an undergraduate student at Grinnell College, I double majored in English and Sociology. I then got a Master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning at University of Iowa and a Ph.D. in Urban Planning and Policy at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). While at UIC, I was an Abraham Lincoln Fellow and also worked for the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement.\nI am the Associate Editor of Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and the City. At University of Illinois, I run the Illinois Housing Lab, and am a faculty affiliate of the Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences, The Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and the Institute of Government and Public Affairs.

    "text": "What is it?\nMost graduate programs in planning require students to complete some kind of major project, workshop, studio, or work of research to substantiate their mastery of the field and ability to practice elements of their craft in an independent and comprehensive way. These experiences are typically 2 semesters long, require some form of sustained and independent engagement or work, and required some form of polished output targeted towards a public audience. At UIUC, we offer two primary pathways to completing this requirement - the completion of a Master’s Project or the completion of a Master’s Thesis.\nIn thinking about how to differentiate between these options, I typically advise students to think about them as having different overall audiences.\nA Master’s Project is typically targeted towards an audience composed of practitioners and the general public, and typically demonstrated skills and approaches most closely associated with professional practice. Therefore, a project typically involves some form of substantial engagement with a policy question or domain associated with practice, and might include substantial engagement and collaboration with other practitioners, community organizations, or the public. A Master’s project can be initiated and completed as an individual or in groups of several students. A Master’s project is written in plain and accessible language, typically contains highly polished visual elements, and oftentimes has a structure that follows that of a plan, policy report, or policy white paper. At UIUC, the final project defense is the presentation of the capstone poster, which happens at our capstone reception every spring.\nA Master’s Thesis is typically targeted towards an audience consisting of researchers and academics, and typically involves major conceptual or empirical investigation of one or more research questions. While much of the structure of a thesis remains up to the author, the format of a thesis is typically prescribed by guidelines produced by the university’s Graduate College, and this format must be reviewed and certified prior to submission. A Thesis must be supervised by a committee of at least two faculty, and a formal thesis defense must be held which is open to the public. In our department, students must complete a formal thesis defense and must also prepare and pin up a poster describing their thesis at our capstone reception every spring."

    "section": "Which Should I Choose?",
    "text": "Which Should I Choose?\nI often have students ask me to help them determine which option might be most appropriate for them. It’s complicated! The majority of MUP students (probably 95 percent) choose to complete the capstone project option, leaving the other 5 percent to choose the thesis option. Why? In general, it’s because the majority of MUP students’ capstones track from professional work that they started through internships, class projects, workshops, or other engagements with practice. The flexibility of the project option also means that some students will complete projects more oriented towards academic research as a project instead of a thesis.\nOther students may be interested in a thesis for a variety of reasons. For those students who are contemplating careers in advanced research or who are considering doctoral-level study, completing a thesis can be a good opportunity to try on advanced research. Likewise, student may have existing research interests or engagements that they wish to expand up by completing a thesis.\nOne thing to keep in mind for research- and “Ph.D.-curious” students is that you do not - let me repeat that - do not - have to pursue the thesis option in order to successfully apply to research jobs or doctoral programs.\nWhen I was a Master’s student, I completed a capstone project - a comprehensive plan written collaboratively with three other Master’s students, and then successfully gained entry into multiple Ph.D. programs and pursued further training and a career as a researcher. Likewise, an employer will likely not think much differently about potentially hiring someone who completed a thesis versus someone who completed a capstone (unless the thesis perfectly dovetails with a particular research project or approach the employer is focused on).\nThis makes the decision more about your desired experience. In general, the capstone takes more time and effort than you anticipate. A project takes a lot of time, particularly in terms of the process of professional engagement that’s typically involved. A thesis takes a lot of time, particularly in terms of conceptualization, getting research approvals (IRB), data collection, and analysis. Students tend to grossly underestimate the time it will take, and fail to front-load the work into the summer and fall of their second year. This can create major challenges during the spring semester when you’re trying to finish classes and initiate a job search. For thesis writers, it is more common that ultimately the thesis will not be complete at the end of the second year, meaning that you may not be ready to defend and graduate until the summer term.\nThis time aspect is important to keep in mind, particularly as you look at the structure of your summer and second year of study, as well as your professional and personal lives. It can be hard to envision what your spring will look like or what parameters will be important as you increasingly spend time on your job search or preparing for further education, but envisioning this can be useful for setting your time. Keep in mind that the capstone is only part of what helps you substantiate your professional expertise and values - you should also invest your time in networking, develop a portfolio of your work, and rehearse a narrative about your professional goals, values, and journey."

    "section": "Your Capstone Proposal",
    "text": "Your Capstone Proposal\nOur department requires you to complete a short capstone proposal at the beginning of your second year in the program. Nominally, this two page proposal requires you to supply the following:\n\nProject Title\nYour name (or names if a group project)\nDescription of project and client\nDetailed work plan with major deadlines\nDivision of labor (for team projects)\nOutline of end product\nDescription of how the project relates to professional goals\nFor joint degree students, a description of how the project integrates both disciplines.\n\n\nInvesting in your proposal\nIt only takes 30 minutes or so to respond to the prompts and write a 2-page proposal. To write a useful 2-page proposal will take substantially more time and thought. Much of that time and thought isn’t actually associated with writing - it’s associated with developing a strong conceptual and practical basis for your work. I strongly suggest that you invest time during the summer in between your first and second years to reflect and draft your capstone proposal. If you’re planning to complete a thesis, have a draft ready for your capstone advisor at the very beginning of the summer so that they can respond and you can strategically use some of the unstructured time during the summer to invest in your work. While your project will (should) continue to evolve, having a strong starting point will pay off, and will allow you to focus on making more manageable decisions about details.\nHere’s a few pointers for ways you can invest in your proposal:\n\nDescription of Project and Client\nFor a master’s project, your description will typically focus on a problem statement, policy issue, or describing a process you will develop or implement. The basics are easy, for example:\n\nWorking in partnership with the Busytown office of planning and development, I will draft a revised zoning ordinance, focused on increasing housing density and reducing the reliance on zoning that is exclusively single-family nature.\n\nThat’s a good start - we know who you’re working with, what the output will be, and what it’s focused on. Don’t stop there, though. Provide background so we understand why these policy changes are needed now.\n\nBusytown’s city council has closely followed ongoing national debates regarding the elimination of single-family zoning. While the city council maintains the position that some single-family zoning should remain, they have asked the planning department to identify criteria for which neighborhoods currently zoned single family might be most appropriate to allow multifamily uses, and have also set a goal of upzoning zones to allow higher-intensity multifamily land uses. The city’s zoning ordinance last received a major update in 1998. In 2019, the city initiated a land use analysis designed to inform zoning reform, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced planning staff to put this analysis on hold. Part of my work will involve collaborating with city staff to resume and complete the process initiated in 2019, and I will then translate findings from this analysis into a series of proposed revisions to the city’s zoning ordinance.\n\nFor a thesis you’ll want to use this section to talk more generally about your project:\n\nMy thesis examines how climate change alters the financial landscape associated with owner-occupied housing in Houston, Texas. Much of our recent understanding of the evolution of financial risk in homeownership has focused on consumer finance and access to capital in the wake of the Great Recession. I focus instead on the evolving landscape of risk associated with homeowner’s insurance in coastal regions of the U.S. that are directly impacted by sea level rise. Drawing from a series of interviews with insurance industry professionals, real estate professionals, and local government officials, I question whether the risk-based pricing model is sustainable within these contexts. I also identify which populations are likely to be most disparately impacted by changes in risk practices.\n\nEssentially this description should serve as an abstract for your thesis. Just like the project description, you should cover the who, what, where, why, and how of your thesis. For a thesis, you may want to think about attaching your overall thesis proposal (which should be longer than two pages). If you have taken my advice and prepared in advance, you’ll already have a thesis proposal and abstract which can be utilized for filing your capstone proposal. Note (at least for my advisees) that I expect a separate and more detailed thesis proposal (typically 4-6 pages) drafted and discussed over the summer between years 1 and 2.\n\n\nDetailed Work Plan with Major Deadlines\nWe now have a pretty clear picture of the what, where, and why of your project, as well as the expected outcomes. Now is time to break these outcomes into distinct work products. These distinct work products may be structured around particular subtasks you’ve identified, the structure of your writing, or by external factors and resources (such as a client’s timeline or when they plan to hold public meetings). Regardless of what factors are imposing structure on your project, the work plan offers an opportunity to define distinct phases of the project. I suggest using these distinct phases as opportunities to solicit feedback from both your client and your advisor.\nThinking about the hypothetical Busytown project, I see three distinct phases:\nPhase 1: Update and complete land use study.\nPhase 2: Develop initial proposal for amendments to the zoning code.\nPhase 3: Develop staff report outlining finalized recommendations for amendments to the zoning code.\nIdentifying phases is useful for breaking the project into manageable chunks. The next challenge is to establish a timeline associated with each of these chunks. I will repeat something I’ve said before - students tend to underestimate the amount of time tasks will take, and often fail to front-load time-intensive tasks into the fall semester to allow more time for writing, analysis, and polishing in the spring. You should keep this in mind and use it to help you develop your realistic plan.\nI typically encourage students to use department and graduate college deadlines to work backwards through their timeline. It is a grave mistake to look at your capstone schedule and simply work backwards from the end of the spring semester. Instead, you should be working back from the department deadline when your draft is due to your adviser. If that date hasn’t been published yet by the department, I suggest to my advisees that you use the end of Spring Break as your deadline to have a complete draft of your capstone. Spring break is a lot earlier than the end of the semester!\nFor thesis students, you will want to work backwards from the Graduate College’s deposit deadline for complete theses. You need to schedule your thesis defense well in advance of this deposit deadline, so that you have sufficient time to incorporate feedback received during your defense into your thesis manuscript. In some cases, your committee may make approving your thesis contingent upon you making some changes. In some cases, committee members may ask to review these changes prior to the final review by your adviser and your deposit. Consequently, I recommend scheduling a thesis defense 2-3 weeks before the Graduate College deposit deadline at the latest. As a courtesy to your committee, you should plan to share your completed thesis manuscript 2 weeks before your defense so they have sufficient time to review. It’s also important to work with your adviser to schedule a defense date early so that you can reserve the time on your committee members’ calendars and so the department can make a public announcement about your defense.\n\n\nOutline of End Product\nI’ve seen students complete this in two ways - one, literally providing an outline that lists major sections in their planned document; and 2, a narrative description of what the end product is. As an adviser, the narrative description is far more useful for accountability and advice giving.\nIn the case of our Busytown land use example, I see several discrete end products that will be incorporated into the capstone:\n\nLand use analysis\nStaff report containing proposed revisions to the zoning code\nCapstone poster\n\nItems 1 and 2 are discrete deliverables that will be delivered to the Busytown planning staff. The student completing this work will combine the substantive elements from these two documents to create the master’s project. They will also submit a poster that summarizes and presents their work to a public audience.\nFor a student writing a thesis, it might be tempting to throw a stock research paper outline in this section and call it good:\n\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nLiterature Review\nResearch Questions\nMethodology\nResults\nDiscussion\nConclusion\n\nAgain, this is not too useful for providing advice or creating general accountability, especially during the early thesis stages where this is particularly important. This is a good time to talk about the main types of evidence and analysis you will use and how this evidence and analysis makes a contribution to our knowledge. For example…\n\nThis thesis draws on a series of interviews conducted with insurance industry professionals, real estate industry professionals, and local government officials in Houston, Texas. I plan to conduct approximately 20 interviews with stakeholders in the Houston metropolitan area. Because of the size of the region, and unevenness in the region’s exposure to risk related to climate change, I use FEMA flood maps and data on recent flooding events to identify where spatial unevenness exists. I then use this information to inform my selection of stakeholders, particularly local government officials and real estate professionals, who are likely to be more bound to working in housing markets with particular risks associated with them.\n\n\nThis approach is novel in that it brings together the voices of industry professionals who are ultiamtely determining how risk is expressed and managed through insurance products. It is also novel in its attempt to explore spatial unevenness in risk patterns by taking a spatially-informed approach to sampling.\n\n\nThis work is important for scholars in the housing policy and natural disaster community, as well as for local and national policymakers concerned with housing affordability, housing stability, and climate change. In addition to the complete thesis manuscript, I intend to work with my adviser to develop an initial manuscript from this work suitable for publication in a scholarly journal like Journal of the American Planning Association or Housing Policy Debate.\n\nThe whole point here is to help us see where you’re going and what your goals are for how people will make use of the insights and contributions from your work.\n\n\nRelationship to Professional Goals\nWe ask this question because it’s important for us to see how your capstone fits into your professional goals. This is part of the narrative setting that will ultimately help you get a job or write a convincing statement for further graduate study.\nIt’s important to understand that we don’t expect you to know exactly what that next step is, but by the point you’re writing this narrative, you should have some sense of the professional capacities and identity you wish to lay claim to when you complete your graduate degree. The more detail you can start to flesh out here, the better the advice and resources your advisor and other program staff can help you with during your second year of study."

As I’ve hope I have been able to make clear, the formal proposal paperwork shouldn’t be seen as the beginning of your project or thesis - it is more like a distinct moment when you describe the basic elements of your project and commit to the foundational principles of your project. The project will continue to evolve as you work and as you receive feedback from your adviser, and from the act of doing the work itself.\nAs I’ve mentioned several times, this part of the Master’s degree is really bespoke to you and your relationship with your adviser. Talk with them early to develop a plan. Ask questions to help flesh out their expectations and to establish shared expectations for your work. Think carefully about how to fully account for the time and effort cost of completing your capstone - and protect this time as you make other personal and professional commitments.\nFrom my perspective as an adviser, the capstone is one of the most fun and interesting ways I get to interact with students and engage with a variety of questions and topics through their work. If we’re working together, I look forward to our collaboration and to many conversations about your work!"

    "section": "What makes an application competitive?",
    "text": "What makes an application competitive?\nApplications can be competitive for different reasons - clearly prior academic history and performance is often a strong indicator of future success. In professional programs, work history can also be an important criteria. In general, I typically look for some kind of sustained engagement that connects to the degree program. This sustained engagement could come in many ways - through your prior academic history and the work you did previously as a student; through your professional history; or through engagement undertaken in your personal life through volunteerism or service to boards or government.\nI find that the most compelling applications can tell me a story about your past, present, and future, offering a clear vision for why you’re seeking to pursue a particular degree, what the fit is that you see between your objectives and the degree program, and what you hope to accomplish during and after your time in the degree program. Applications that are both well-written and that show time and research about the program and its faculty are likely to stand out.\nHere are some of the general questions which I typically consider when reading a graduate application:\n\nAre they qualified?: Does this candidate meet our basic standards for admission to the program? Do they meet our departmental criteria? Do they meet the university’s criteria? Are there any areas we may need to provide justification for (for instance a prior graduate degree of the same level in a similar field or a GPA that falls below our departmental or institutional standards).\nDo they understand what the degree does?: Does the candidate seem to understand what the degree they’re applying for is likely to offer with regards to professional and scholarly opportunities? Do they have a clear vision for their own goals for pursuing the degree?\nDo they represent a good fit with our strengths?: In looking primarily at your personal statement and statement of purpose, we’re looking to see how your interests and stated goals fit with our understanding of our department’s strengths. There are some times where highly qualified students may simply not be a good fit with a program because they want to work in an area a program is not strong in. For instance, if a highly-qualified student wants to do advanced research on urban design, but they apply to a program whose faculty’s strength is in policy-based planning, there may simply be a lack of fit that will come up in our admissions deliberation.\nAre they likely to be successful?: Similar to the question of fit, I am typically looking for evidence that a student is likely to be successful in the program they are applying for. Success is qualified through how you (and your letter writers) frame your past, present, and future.\nWhat unique perspectives do they bring?: We want to build a cohort full of diverse and interesting students - while these things are typically not the make or break element of your application, providing an understanding of your perspective and experience can add important context to your application."

    "section": "How can I best represent myself?",
    "text": "How can I best represent myself?\nNow that you have some sense of what admission committees are likely to be looking at, let’s talk about how you might best represent yourself.\nFirst off, make the most out of your statements. In the case of the graduate programs I work with, this includes a statement of purpose and a statement of personal history. The statement of purpose is essentially the keystone to all of your other application components. The statement of personal history helps us understand your trajectory and how your life experiences serve as context for your decision to pursue graduate studies.\nThe statement of purpose is (in my opinion) the most important component of the application. It is your best opportunity to provide context and framing for your other application materials. The remaining materials serve as evidence in this argument you’re making. The statement of purpose is also where you can help your application reviewers understand these elements of your application - both in terms of things that you want to stand out, but also in terms of helping us have context for things like a weak GPA or a gap in work history, for instance.\n\nOver reliance on chronology: applicants will essentially use their statements as a narrative version of their resume. The reality is that we already have your resume as part of your application materials - re-hashing your accomplishments without helping us understand why these things are significant or how they helped transform your thinking is essentially wasting our attention. This does not mean that chronology can’t be a useful tool, but avoid re-stating what we can already glean through your other application materials.\nUnder-emphasis on perspective: students oftentimes want to present a very neutral picture of themselves. While I’m not suggesting that you put every one of your quirks of hot takes in your application, providing a genuine sense of yourself and your perspective through your writing can help us greatly in our assessment of fit and our sense of what you’ll bring to our graduate programs.\nLack of attention to fit: in an application cycle, an admission committee can go through tens if not hundreds of applications. Those applicants who demonstrate that they understand the program, its faculty, and its context help us greatly in answering the question of fit and preparedness. It’s typically clear when an applicant is using very general text about the university or fit, or when they get basic facts wrong about our program or context. These types of omissions and errors are not likely to sink an application, but they may influence our overall confidence in the application.\n\nSo what can you do to represent yourself well?\n\nInvest time in your statements: These statements are the keystone of your application. Take the time to write a thoughtful and compelling narrative that speaks to your past, present, and future, demonstrates why you are choosing to pursue graduate studies, and that articulates your professional goals during and after you receive the degree.\nChoose letter writers judiciously: Letters of reference will likely look different if you’ve just recently graduated from another degree program than if you’ve been working for ten years. I would anticipate that a recent graduate would be more likely to rely upon letters of reference from faculty they have worked closely with. I would anticipate that someone whose been working might rely more upon a supervisor for a letter. Regardless of who you select to write your letters, consider drawing upon these writers to address of cover different aspects of your history or life.\nMention faculty: mention faculty who you are particularly interested in working with. This helps us assess fit, and can help us with advising assignments, and helping you be in touch with these faculty throughout the admission process.\nAddress your weaknesses: If you see weaknesses or things that may raise questions in your application, address them head-on particularly in your statements.\nProofread, proofread, proofread: Spelling, grammar, and detail issues are not likely to sink an application, but they do speak to your level of attention and commitment to representing yourself well."

    "section": "How can I identify my fit with a program?",
    "text": "How can I identify my fit with a program?\nA lot of my comments have focused on the question of fit. In addition to substantiating your qualifications for a graduate program, your application is arguing for your fit with the strengths of the program. This means that you need to do some due diligence prior to and during the application process to identify fit. Here’s a few strategies:\n\nResearch: Spend some time researching the programs you’re interested in. I’d suggest not only looking at the names of the universities the program is in (of course some people apply to prestigious institutions because they are interested in the value of being associated with the name of that institution), but also in terms of the core strengths of the faculty in your area of study, what types of roles past and recent alumni are working in, where students coming into the program come from, and what types of support are available for your studies and professional development.\nContact: Reach out to the admissions officer or graduate program director, or directly to current faculty, students, or alumni. In the case of program faculty, we are always happy to answer questions regarding the program. It may not be useful to contact a graduate program director and say can I have more information on the program? - generally, there’s comprehensive information on our website, and we’ll then write an email directing you to what you should have already read before reaching out. Instead, focus on more specific questions, or request the opportunity to have an informational conversation (and come ready with questions about the program).\nConnect: Use tools like LinkedIn and personal networks to identify program alumni, particularly those who you might already have connections with and ask them not only about their experiences with the program, but also who you should talk to within the program. They’ll oftentimes be able to offer a unique perspective which you won’t be able to get elsewhere.\nExplore: Spend some time sleuthing on the program and department’s website. You can oftentimes find things like past thesis and dissertations completed by recent alumni, course syllabi, awards won by students, and engaged projects which classes have done with local communities. Taking time to do this kind of sleuthing can greatly inform your own application and materials.\n\nFor Ph.D. students, all of the above is important, but it’s particularly important to identify and reach out to a potential Ph.D. advisor before you submit your application. This advisor is not only an important portion of your doctoral studies, but ultimately, they’re also the one ultimately making the commitment (intellectual and financial) to take you on. While sometimes these connections can be built after your application is submitted, having contact and assessing fit with an advisor before your apply may help you figure out which programs and advisers to prioritize. Checking out our faculty websites isn’t sufficient for assessing fit - talk with us, ask us about our work, ask us about our future agenda, and ask us about our advising style. Most importantly, ask us about our plans to take on a new advisee in the near future - this may save you time (and money!). You will likely be surprised at how much these conversations may shape which applications you end up prioritizing."

Our department attempts to match students with faculty academic advisers based upon overlap in areas of interest (based upon what you write in your application materials), but in general, all faculty should be qualified to help students develop their plan of study and navigate basic institutional systems.\nAn academic adviser may also be required to provide letters of recommendation or support for competitive funding opportunities like campus or external fellowships. The role of your academic adviser is particularly important during your first year of study, as you seek to get your bearings and navigate expectations for graduate studies.\n\n\nCapstone Adviser\nFor our Master’s students, capstone advisers focus on providing substantive advice, feedback, and guidance on the capstone completed during the second year of study. This involves becoming familiar with your proposed work, signing off on your proposal, providing oversight and guidance throughout the capstone, and serving as the final reviewer and certifier of our capstone deliverables (manuscript and poster). It’s your responsibility to identify which faculty will serve as your capstone adviser - you have to ask and they have to agree to work with you. As with so many things, proaction and clear communication is the key to building the relationship and commitment with the faculty you’d like to work with.\nIn some cases, your existing academic adviser is the natural fit for your capstone adviser. In other cases, you may choose to identify a different faculty member to serve as your capstone adviser. Selecting a capstone adviser doesn’t automatically change who your academic adviser is, though. Many students ultimately make the choice to switch their official academic adviser to be the person who is serving as their capstone adviser - this gives you a “one stop shop” for academic and capstone advising in your second year. It’s ultimately up to you if you choose to consolidate these roles or prefer to keep them separate. Whatever you choose to do, make sure both advisers know of your choice, and make sure the Director of Graduate Studies also knows so that we can update our records and communicate with the correct person for matters related to your academic advising and/or capstone."

    "section": "What’s the role of a Ph.D. supervisor?",
    "text": "What’s the role of a Ph.D. supervisor?\nFor those students who are beginning a Ph.D. program, it’s important to note that the role of a Ph.D. supervisor is oftentimes different than the role of an academic or capstone adviser when you were a Master’s student. In most cases, the role of a Ph.D. supervisor is far more active in shaping your experience and education at the doctoral level. That individual has made a commitment of time, attention, and financial resources to support your training as a doctoral student.\nEarly during your time in the program, the adviser’s role is to help you develop an initial plan of study, select classes, and oftentimes to spend time talking with you to get to understand your research, your mindset, and your goals for completing a Ph.D.. Your adviser may also get you involved early on in research projects or grant writing for existing projects. During this phase, you are the quintessential apprentice, working frequently alongside your adviser while also pursuing your own research agenda and building the skills and perspectives needed to pursue your work.\n\nPlan of Study\nIn our Ph.D. program, you will undertake an independent study with your adviser during your first semester to flesh out your initial plan of study and to begin work on two literature reviews that focus on knowledge domains related to your areas of interest. Advisers will take different approaches to these early relationship-building activities - some may be more passive and simply look to provide feedback after you’ve spent time working towards these deliverables, while others may be more active in shaping and reviewing your interim work. It’s up to you to talk and communicate in order to develop shared expectations during this early getting to know you period. At the end of your first year, you’ll have a plan of study “defense” - this is basically a review of what you’ve done and a more formal opportunity for your adviser and another faculty member to provide you with feedback on your evolving plans.\nAs you advance during your time in the program, your adviser’s role will evolve as well. The next major milestones to focus on will be the completion of your literature reviews and the iterative evolution of your plan of study document. The idea here is that by bringing together substantive knowledge in your area of expertise through the literature reviews with your own reflection, goal setting, and claim making about your chosen domains of intellectual expertise, that these things together will serve as foundational documents which will be used as part of your qualifying exam.\n\n\nThe Qualifying Exam\nIn our department, we offer two pathways to qualifying - a research paper pathway and an examination pathway. For those students who are working with (or considering working with) me, please note that I have a strong preference for using the examination pathway for the qualifying exam. In my opinion, the examination (if done the way I prefer to do it) serves as a more holistic opportunity to examine and provide feedback on your identity and approach as an academic. Typically, we’ll design the examination to test your expertise at the intersection of knowledge domains you lay claim to, your chosen expertise with regards to methodology, and expertise with regards to theory related to your work. To my mind, the best exam questions help you to grow into this identity, which you’ll carry forward into your future work.\nMany advisees get nervous when they hear the word exam used in this context. While it’s very true that there are stakes associated with the results of this exam (that can include dismissal from the program if results are unsatisfactory), know that your adviser should not let you schedule your exam until they are confident that you can not just pass it, but knock it out of the park. Much of the feedback you will receive following your exam will focus on how to continue to shape your scholarly identity and research based upon what you’ve shared with us. We will also typically be talking about and thinking about implications of your writing in your exam for your dissertation research.\nThe other role your adviser will play during this stage is helping you to select exam committee members strategically, and thinking about how many of these members may also be aligning with your dissertation committee. You should have thoughts in mind, and also be open to feedback, not only on what you see committee members bringing individually and as an ensemble to your work, but also your understanding of the interpersonal dynamics between committee members. Please know that we as advisers are also thinking carefully about this, as we may have prior experience with how other members tend to interact with each other, who is likely to get along, and who might add more complication to your committee. Just understand that it’s your process and your committee, but also understand the reasons we may give certain types of feedback.\nIn some cases, we may suggest a joint preliminary exam review and dissertation proposal defense, but in most cases, we want you to have a break and a chance to think and reflect in between the two. While there’s a lot more to say about the dissertation proposal and defense, my goal for my advisees is to move relatively quickly from one to the other - it’s easy to get stuck in a kind of doldrums in between your exam and proposal defense (speaking from personal experience).\n\n\nDissertation Proposal Defense\nThe final steps - the dissertation proposal defense and dissertation defense are really all about constructive feedback. The dissertation proposal defense is basically our last change to really do substantive shaping of your dissertation project. Yes, again, there’s a gatekeeping function here in terms of go/no-go on the dissertation research, but your adviser should set expectations that you have met individually with your other committee members so they are on board with the general concept of your dissertation proposal before the defense.\nFrom an advising perspective, the proposal defense is really the chance for us to collaborate on giving you feedback, and for you to get feedback consolidated all in one place. It’s also a chance to get your committee all on board with a shared set of expectations for your work. During this process, your adviser should help mediate, and should help collect and organize the feedback which you have received. They may help identify committee members who are interested (or feel the need to) give particular advice or support around a particular area of your work, and will help to develop a collective sense of your timeline and the activities that will happen as you are working through your dissertation.\nYou may leave your proposal defense with a punchlist of issues to resolve or questions to engage with, but you should also leave feeling empowered to move forward (independently) with your work. Then it’s off to the races (or literally off to the research)!\n\n\nThe Dissertation Defense\nThe final stage here is your dissertation defense. Of course, you will meet regularly with your adviser while you’re performing the dissertation research, and should meet and share writing regularly as you write up your dissertation. Your adviser will also help determine when you should share chapters or sections of your dissertation manuscript with other committee members. Some may commit to reading along the way and providing feedback, and others may focus on reading later on when you have a complete manuscript ready to go in advance of your defense.\nDuring this stage, you should confirm with your adviser what roles you want committee members to play - providing feedback on specific areas like methods, theory, or your discussion. You should also talk with your adviser about how to share interim findings through publications, reports, op-eds, and other venues.\nThe defense is a big moment - a public celebration of your work, and also a final moment for your adviser and the committee to help you polish your presentation. Like the proposal defense, your adviser will likely do less speaking and more listening so that your committee members can weigh in and you can focus on listening to what they have to say. Behind the scenes, your adviser has likely had some pre-conversation with committee members about your dissertation manuscript, and has some sense of the feedback you will receive.\nMy goal for the end of a students’ defense is to be able to hand them a “punchlist” of specific items to address, with some sense of an order of priority. If specific committee members feel that they need to revisit or review items in your punchlist, I will try to itemize that and then will confirm with you later on that this has been done. Following your defense, we will work to address items in your punchlist based upon their priority and will then focus on final review for submission and certification."

What allows you to advance is how you bring together what you’ve learned in school with practical wisdom gained through practice.\nInternships allow you to integrate and process what you’ve learned through its application. Hopefully, internship experiences help you to better understand how classroom knowledge and skills are applied in practice, increases your experience in their application, and helps build your confidence and grounding as a practitioner. As such, while any internship can be beneficial, it makes sense for someone at the graduate level to focus on internship experiences that are going to directly contribute to their own vision for planning practice."

    "section": "What makes an internship useful?",
    "text": "What makes an internship useful?\nInternships can be useful for a lot of reasons, however, I find that oftentimes my graduate students begin compulsively applying for internships without taking the time to reflect on how an internship will advance their specific goals and needs. Let’s explore systematically:\nExperience: This may seem very obvious, but clearly internships can help you gain experience with practice. The value of this experience, however, is very different if you’ve never had a professional job or all of your prior experience is in a very different area. Taking the time to reflect on what the value of experience is for you is important for articulating your internship goals.\nNetworks: Internships should help you build (or add depth to) your personal and professional networks. Urban planning is ultimately a “small” field where professional networks can make a major difference in how you enter the field and in the opportunities available to you. Internships give you a point of entry, and allow you to start to build a reputation. Even if you ultimately choose to pursue professional opportunities in other areas of practice that are not directly connected to your internship, the networks and connections you build during the internship can still be instrumental to those new opportunities. Assuming you build a strong repoire with staff at your internship, you should also expect that your supervisor or other staff may continue to help you with informal mentorship and navigation in the job market following the conclusion of your internship - of course that is not a requirement, but I”ve often found that studenrts are surprised when the first see a network of professionals working on their behalf.\nAt the beginning of an internship, there may not be much to reflect on with regards to networks. It does often make sense to be able to clearly articulate to a supervisor or hiring manager your goals, and this might include some professional development goals alongside goals related to experience.\nAccess - geographic: Along with experience and networks, internships can be an important way to gain strategic exposure to practice in a particular geographic location. Every place has its unique characteristics that shape how practice happens, and having some experience, even limited experience over the course of an internship can make a big difference for subsequent job applications in that place. As you reflect upon your overall goals, you may find that you have some insight into the type of context or location you would like to work in after you graduate. This may help you prioritize internship opportunities that offer you access or exposure to that context or to similar places."

    "text": "How can I effectively identify and pursue internship opportunities?\nHopefully, some of the above thoughts have helped you start to articulate a set of goals associated with pursuing an internship. These goals should help you to focus your internship search. A big mistake that I see a lot of students making is that they apply for (literally) everything. For a graduate student, there are almost no cases where I think this makes sense. Slowing down, taking time to be deliberate, and developing an approach that prioritizes certain positions often makes more sense. Let’s break down some advice about the internship search strategy.\nHave a Strategy: I see many graduate students initiating their internship search too early and without a clear strategy in mind. Having a plan is crucial, and allows you to focus time and effort into attaining your goals in an internship search. Taking the time to articulate your goals as well as a strategy for achieving them is crucial. Thinking critically about what evidence will allow you to determine whether there’s a good match between a potential opportunity and your goals is also important.\nSearch Passively and Actively: I find that most graduate students conduct passive internship searches - they wait for positions to be posted on job boards or websites. Of course a passive search strategy can yield results, and in some cases, you may even know to expect that certain agencies or employers will advertise positions this way. For most graduate students, however, a search strategy that relies only on a passive strategy will be frustrating, and will not yield great results. Active search strategies would include approaches where it’s you reaching out or making connections independently of an advertised internship or job position.\nReaching out and making connections may come through networking, informational interviews, engagement through classes, or asking academic or professional contacts to make a connection on your behalf. Clearly, an active strategy is more “costly” in terns of time and effort. This means that you will have to be strategic in using this strategy, focusing on potential employers for who you see a very strong fit or value added for you to benefit from. Think about this as part of a hierarchical strategy - you may want to focus active search strategies on a narrow set of potential employers who you see a very strong fit with and then rely upon some combination of active and passive strategies for a broader set of positions that are of interest, but for which you see less of a compelling fit. You might also focus on active outreach and engagement early in your internship search, have a period when you choose to focus more on passive search strategies, and then start to integrate active search strategies again as you get close to your preferred start date or availability to work as an intern.\nIn pursuing an active strategy, it’s important to understand that every contact you make or conversation you solicit will not pay off. You’re oftentimes asking a busy practitioner to take time from their work to engage with you or get to know about your work or overall goals. Some people will be more or less receptive to this. If you don’t get a response or get a negative response, don’t take it as a sign that they are not interested in helping you or don’t see a good reason to engage with you - professionals are often just busy and have to prioritize where their effort is going at a given time.\nIf you reach out to someone or leverage your contacts to have them reach out on your behalf, you better be ready if they respond positively! Do your homework. Know something about the individual and know things about they agency they work for. Have specific questions in mind that show you’re thinking purposefully and seriously.

    "text": "Projects\n\nThe Ecology of Rental Housing Regulation in Illinois\n\nProject Summary\nHousing code enforcement has been described as “law in action” (Ross, 1995). Within the local government context, municipal code enforcement involves decision makers operating across a highly uneven and diverse tapestry of neighborhoods and living situations (Diver, 1980). Implicit in code enforcement practices is a blending of objective health and safety concerns with highly subjective social and cultural norms (Krieger, 2008). While code enforcement activities are vital for protecting individual and collective public health, safety, and wellbeing, the potential harms caused by implicit bias and differential treatment are great (Hirsch, 1983), and the material consequences and stakes grow increasingly higher, especially as cities adopt stronger nuisance and crime-free housing ordinances (Werth, 2013). Understanding the potential for bias within code enforcement systems brings up two important areas of concern: uneven enforcement and uneven outcomes.\nOne set of concerns involves the discretion of local government code enforcement officials, who may enforce codes differently based upon the racial or socioeconomic status of tenants, landlords, or the neighborhood in which the property is located. In some cases, such differential enforcement may be desirable from an equity perspective – it may recognize and help to minimize the impacts of hardships for tenants and landlords. Conversely, such discretion may increase housing instability, eviction, and displacement. Policy evaluation can help to uncover when and where such regulatory discretion is racialized, the consequences for tenants, landlords, and government, and the ways in which such discretion addresses or exacerbates local government and neighborhood equity concerns.\nThe second area of immediate concern involves the contribution of code enforcement to evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Renters are currently protected by an uneven patchwork of federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums. While eviction moratoria provided protections for tenants from non-payment of rent, eviction for other reasons can proceed regardless of health and safety consequences despite evidence that evictions increase the spread of COVID (Nande, et al., 2021). Landlords may turn to justifications that are supported by nuisance or code enforcement violations as opposed to non-payment of rent as a lever to remove tenants amidst a continually evolving public health crisis (Layser, et al., 2021).\nIn response to these two domains of concern, we evaluate local government rental property regulation and the application of nuisance and crime-free housing ordinances to assess the extent to which discretionary enforcement increases affordability, housing stability, and access to resource-rich neighborhoods, especially for people of color. Our goal is to use evaluation methods to inform code enforcement approaches that avoid targeting on the basis of race or income, avoid displacement, maintain affordable rental units, and provide landlords with opportunities to secure financial resources for property improvements. We propose conducting an in-depth comparative evaluation of the 28 local governments in Illinois with populations between 50,000 to 500,000, with the idea that variations observed in larger or smaller cities are likely to be more idiosyncratic or due to other complicating factors.\n\nThis evaluation reflects a novel partnership between policy advocates and researchers that leverages Housing Action Illinois’ connections with local communities, commitment to storytelling for change and centering the voices of people with lived experiences in their policy efforts, and a diverse practice-focused audience for evaluation findings, with University of Illinois’ advanced housing policy research capacity and opportunities to train emerging policy practitioners and researchers. The evaluation brings together code enforcement stakeholders’ perspectives to contextualize local trends associated with racial segregation, housing instability, and eviction – all revealed as major issues for Illinois’ cities outside of Chicago in a 2019 Governing Magazine investigation Segregation in the Heartland (Vock, Charles, and Maciag, 2019). We draw upon a combination of traditional policy evaluation techniques coupled with documentary video to develop policy-informed narratives to share with local governments, landlords, and tenants, but also with housing advocates and housing policy and legal researchers.\n\n\nFunder\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation Policies for Action Institute of Government and Public Affairs\n\n\nPartners\nHousing Action Illinois\n\n\nStaff\nAndrew Greenlee (PI), Illinois Housing Lab Sharon Legenza (PI), Housing Action Illinois Foluke Akanni, Housing Action Illinois Mare Ralph, Housing Action Illinois Anagha Devanarayanan, Illinois Housing Lab Bob Palmer, Housing Action Illinois Emma Walters, Illinois Housing Lab David Wright, Illinois Housing Lab\n\n\n\nNeighborhood Change, Structural Racism, and Health\n\nProject Summary\nStructural and institutional racism remain integral parts of housing policy in the United States. High levels of racial and economic segregation expose some residents to more adverse conditions that have important social, economic, and physiological outcomes. This project examines the relationship between exposure to structural racism at the neighborhood level and health outcomes for both mothers and their babies. This project sets out to illustrate the relationship between neighborhood housing disparities and health disparities with important implication for the intergenerational transfer of health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\nPartners\nDr. Christine Joseph, Henry Ford Health Alexandra Sitarik, Henry Ford Health Cheryl Miree, Henry Ford Health Dr. Ganesa Wegienka, Henry Ford Health Dr. Denise White-Perkins, Henry Ford Health\n\n\nStaff\nAndrew Greenlee\n\n\n\nThe Socio-Spatial Ecology of Bed Bugs\n\nProject Summary\nThis project examines the residential environment as an integrated socio-environmental system. We focus on the relationship between bed bugs and housing as a tightly coupled system because humans are the primary host of bed bugs, and housing units are the primary location of bed bug infestations. Bed bug infestations require intensive treatment routines which have major financial consequences for property owners and occupants, and which also result in physical disruptions to the living environment. Since bed bugs can disperse actively by crawling in between housing units and passively by latching onto clothes, backpacks, and other easily carried items, infestations in multi-unit dwellings can rapidly grow in size, complexity, and cost to treat.\nOur work on bed bug infestations in Chicago (Sutherland et al., 2021) and New York (McLafferty et al. 2020) has shown that bed bugs are not evenly distributed across the socio-economic landscape. In Chicago, bed bug infestations are strongly associated with both income and crowding at the neighborhood level. Bed bug prevalence is higher in lower income neighborhoods with higher levels of household crowding. Further, we find that bed bug infestations are positively associated with eviction risk, further connecting bed bugs to issues of poverty and mobility. Bed bugs increase the disproportionate allocation of public health burdens upon neighborhoods facing multiple dimensions of disadvantage.\nUrban housing policy interventions traditionally engage three sets of institutions – the state, the market, and the individual. The state sets regulations that govern the location and diversity of housing (zoning), and housing quality and occupancy standards (building codes) for housing. The state also uses incentives and sanctions to ensure that residential environments meet minimum standards, and also that market actors are fair in their treatment of housing consumers. In theory, the market supplies housing to meet the demands of housing consumers, and ensures housing stock diversity reflective of the needs of housing consumers. Market actors also serve as gatekeepers to housing opportunities and neighborhoods, which reflect push and pull factors for housing consumers. Households search for and consume housing that balances household needs, budgets, and access to neighborhood resources.\nBed bugs have recently undergone a resurgence and inserted themselves into this system, potentially altering its behavior. Bed bugs cause changes in behavior of governments (policy), markets (rent) and individuals (moves), and in turn, these institutions affect bed bug population dynamics (population growth, dispersal, local extirpation, evolution of dispersal behavior and pesticide resistance). The recent resurgence of bed bugs has caused a range of local policy responses and debates. For instance, New York City is currently implementing disclosure policies that require landlords to notify prospective tenants whether their unit was previously treated for a bedbug infestation. Chicago’s bedbug policies use an escalating fee structure to encourage landlords to treat infestations quickly once they are discovered. In other parts of the country, active policy debate and legislative advocacy is occurring regarding whether bed bug infestations should be considered either the tenant or landlord’s responsibility to treat (Schneider 2019). Related to this debate are broader questions of how bed bug infestations contribute to household precarity and to elevated rates of eviction, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. By treating bed bugs and housing as an integrated social and environmental system, we seek to address several basic yet unanswered questions about the spatial and demographic determinants of bed bug prevalence. We then use the answers to these basic questions to examine how policy interventions may have intended and unintended consequences associated with the types of feedback processes we believe are inherent to this system.\n\n\nFunder\nNational Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center University of Illinois Center for Social and Behavioral Science Chancellor’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice\n\n\nPartners\nDr. Alison Hill, Johns Hopkins University Dr. Michael Z.

These histories are cross-referenced with a suite of neighborhood-level sociodemographic and housing indicators, overlays for flood and inundation risk, and COVID-19 infection rates to understand the contribution of neighborhood-level factors.\nThrough longitudinal spatial data analysis, the researchers will model a) the likelihood of a voucher-subsidized household moving as they relate to housing and non-housing neighborhood conditions, and b) the likelihood of moving to or from low-income neighborhoods. These models will help us to answer a set of question regarding whether housing vouchers help to mitigate housing instability due to both housing cost and other related factors.\n\n\nFunder\nTexas Southern University Center of Excellence for Housing and Community Development Policy Research (CEHCDPR)\n\n\nPartners\nTexas Southern University Center of Excellence for Housing and Community Development Policy Research (CEHCDPR)\n\n\nStaff\nAndrew Greenlee,  Rose Ravi Krishnan\n\n\n\nMeasuring Neighborhood-Level Affordable Housing Dynamics in the Boston Region\n\nProject Summary\nThis project engages two major questions about housing affordability in the Boston region. It questions 1) what unique mixes of government actors are subsidizing housing for low-income individuals; and 2) how well regional Federal Fair Market Rent (FMR) standards align with the incomes of Boston residents, again at the neighborhood level.\nFederal, State, and Local Actors: The Boston region is served by a complex network of affordable housing subsidies, rules, and regulations drawing from federal, state, and local policy. There is a need to understand which programs are serving which neighborhoods, and how the number of subsidized units present at the neighborhood level has changed over time.\nFair Market Rent Standards: The Boston region’s Area Median Income (AMI) guides the rules for setting affordable rents within subsidized and inclusionary housing programs, yet the regional AMI is substantially different from the distribution of incomes at the city and neighborhood level.\nOutputs from this project include an interactive web tool to explore sources of affordable housing at the local level and a tool to explore multiple definitions of housing affordability at the neighborhood level.\n\n\nFunder\nMIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study\n\n\nPartners\nMIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study\n\n\nStaff\nJulia Paiva Emma Walters"
