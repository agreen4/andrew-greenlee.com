    "text": "I’m an Associate Professor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I teach and research at the intersection of housing policy, neighborhood change, and social equity in cities.\nMy research uses housing and residential mobility as a way to explore a range of deeper questions about our cities including health, equity, and governance of change. As an urban planner, I use a range of methods - both qualitative and quantitative - to explore these issues, oftentimes in partnership with community partners, institutional stakeholders, and researchers from other disciplines. My goal is to tell vivid stories about cities that have the power to transform how we plan and who we plan for.\nI became a housing policy researcher due in part to my experience growing up in Chicago. Growing up, I observed the ways in which housing contributed to segregation and uneven development. I became an urban planner with the goal of addressing these types of issues, and focused my practice on housing and community development. I chose to become an academic researcher in order to bring new perspective and influence to our understanding of housing and neighborhoods.\nAs an undergraduate student at Grinnell College, I double majored in English and Sociology. I then got a Master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning at University of Iowa and a Ph.D. in Urban Planning and Policy at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). While at UIC, I was an Abraham Lincoln Fellow and also worked for the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement.\nI am the Associate Editor of Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and the City. At University of Illinois, I run the Illinois Housing Lab, and am a faculty affiliate of the Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences, The Lemann Center for Brazilian Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and the Institute of Government and Public Affairs. In the Office for the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, I serve as a Faculty Adviser for the Office of Research Advising and Project Development (RAPD).\nIn the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, I serve as the Director of Admissions for the Master of Urban Planning program, the faculty leader for the undergraduate and graduate Community Development for Social Justice concentrations, and serve as the Associate Head of the department.\n\n\n\nHeadshot and Bio\nHeadshot Biographical Statement Curriculum Vitae HTML | PDF Google Scholar"

While our focus will be on analyzing current conditions, we will also learn how to tell stories about neighborhood change, and will learn how to project and forecast future trends. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will learn how to design primary data collection strategies to fill in gaps in knowledge gained through exploration and analysis of existing data.\n\n\n\nThe Doctoral Urban Planning seminar is a platform for intellectual development for PhD students in the Department of Urban & Regional Planning and a medium for building a community of scholars. The seminars facilitate the exchange of ideas and perspectives among urban planning Ph.D. students and faculty. The seminar is intended to benefit doctoral students across all stages in their research and doctoral studies, and provides a shared space for students to present their research and to solicit critical, yet constructive, peer reviews and advice."

    "text": "Projects\n\nThe Ecology of Rental Housing Regulation in Illinois\n\nProject Summary\nHousing code enforcement has been described as “law in action” (Ross, 1995). Within the local government context, municipal code enforcement involves decision makers operating across a highly uneven and diverse tapestry of neighborhoods and living situations (Diver, 1980). Implicit in code enforcement practices is a blending of objective health and safety concerns with highly subjective social and cultural norms (Krieger, 2008). While code enforcement activities are vital for protecting individual and collective public health, safety, and wellbeing, the potential harms caused by implicit bias and differential treatment are great (Hirsch, 1983), and the material consequences and stakes grow increasingly higher, especially as cities adopt stronger nuisance and crime-free housing ordinances (Werth, 2013). Understanding the potential for bias within code enforcement systems brings up two important areas of concern: uneven enforcement and uneven outcomes.\nOne set of concerns involves the discretion of local government code enforcement officials, who may enforce codes differently based upon the racial or socioeconomic status of tenants, landlords, or the neighborhood in which the property is located. In some cases, such differential enforcement may be desirable from an equity perspective – it may recognize and help to minimize the impacts of hardships for tenants and landlords. Conversely, such discretion may increase housing instability, eviction, and displacement. Policy evaluation can help to uncover when and where such regulatory discretion is racialized, the consequences for tenants, landlords, and government, and the ways in which such discretion addresses or exacerbates local government and neighborhood equity concerns.\nThe second area of immediate concern involves the contribution of code enforcement to evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Renters are currently protected by an uneven patchwork of federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums. While eviction moratoria provided protections for tenants from non-payment of rent, eviction for other reasons can proceed regardless of health and safety consequences despite evidence that evictions increase the spread of COVID (Nande, et al., 2021). Landlords may turn to justifications that are supported by nuisance or code enforcement violations as opposed to non-payment of rent as a lever to remove tenants amidst a continually evolving public health crisis (Layser, et al., 2021).\nIn response to these two domains of concern, we evaluate local government rental property regulation and the application of nuisance and crime-free housing ordinances to assess the extent to which discretionary enforcement increases affordability, housing stability, and access to resource-rich neighborhoods, especially for people of color. Our goal is to use evaluation methods to inform code enforcement approaches that avoid targeting on the basis of race or income, avoid displacement, maintain affordable rental units, and provide landlords with opportunities to secure financial resources for property improvements. We propose conducting an in-depth comparative evaluation of the 28 local governments in Illinois with populations between 50,000 to 500,000, with the idea that variations observed in larger or smaller cities are likely to be more idiosyncratic or due to other complicating factors.\n\nThis evaluation reflects a novel partnership between policy advocates and researchers that leverages Housing Action Illinois’ connections with local communities, commitment to storytelling for change and centering the voices of people with lived experiences in their policy efforts, and a diverse practice-focused audience for evaluation findings, with University of Illinois’ advanced housing policy research capacity and opportunities to train emerging policy practitioners and researchers. The evaluation brings together code enforcement stakeholders’ perspectives to contextualize local trends associated with racial segregation, housing instability, and eviction – all revealed as major issues for Illinois’ cities outside of Chicago in a 2019 Governing Magazine investigation Segregation in the Heartland (Vock, Charles, and Maciag, 2019). We draw upon a combination of traditional policy evaluation techniques coupled with documentary video to develop policy-informed narratives to share with local governments, landlords, and tenants, but also with housing advocates and housing policy and legal researchers.\n\n\nFunder\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation Policies for Action Institute of Government and Public Affairs\n\n\nPartners\nHousing Action Illinois\n\n\nStaff\nAndrew Greenlee (PI), Illinois Housing Lab Sharon Legenza (PI), Housing Action Illinois Foluke Akanni, Housing Action Illinois Mare Ralph, Housing Action Illinois Anagha Devanarayanan, Illinois Housing Lab Bob Palmer, Housing Action Illinois Emma Walters, Illinois Housing Lab David Wright, Illinois Housing Lab\n\n\n\nNeighborhood Change, Structural Racism, and Health\n\nProject Summary\nStructural and institutional racism remain integral parts of housing policy in the United States. High levels of racial and economic segregation expose some residents to more adverse conditions that have important social, economic, and physiological outcomes. This project examines the relationship between exposure to structural racism at the neighborhood level and health outcomes for both mothers and their babies. This project sets out to illustrate the relationship between neighborhood housing disparities and health disparities with important implication for the intergenerational transfer of health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\nPartners\nDr. Christine Joseph, Henry Ford Health Alexandra Sitarik, Henry Ford Health Cheryl Miree, Henry Ford Health Dr. Ganesa Wegienka, Henry Ford Health Dr. Denise White-Perkins, Henry Ford Health\n\n\nStaff\nAndrew Greenlee\n\n\n\nThe Socio-Spatial Ecology of Bed Bugs\n\nProject Summary\nThis project examines the residential environment as an integrated socio-environmental system. We focus on the relationship between bed bugs and housing as a tightly coupled system because humans are the primary host of bed bugs, and housing units are the primary location of bed bug infestations. Bed bug infestations require intensive treatment routines which have major financial consequences for property owners and occupants, and which also result in physical disruptions to the living environment. Since bed bugs can disperse actively by crawling in between housing units and passively by latching onto clothes, backpacks, and other easily carried items, infestations in multi-unit dwellings can rapidly grow in size, complexity, and cost to treat.\nOur work on bed bug infestations in Chicago (Sutherland et al., 2021) and New York (McLafferty et al. 2020) has shown that bed bugs are not evenly distributed across the socio-economic landscape. In Chicago, bed bug infestations are strongly associated with both income and crowding at the neighborhood level. Bed bug prevalence is higher in lower income neighborhoods with higher levels of household crowding. Further, we find that bed bug infestations are positively associated with eviction risk, further connecting bed bugs to issues of poverty and mobility. Bed bugs increase the disproportionate allocation of public health burdens upon neighborhoods facing multiple dimensions of disadvantage.\nUrban housing policy interventions traditionally engage three sets of institutions – the state, the market, and the individual. The state sets regulations that govern the location and diversity of housing (zoning), and housing quality and occupancy standards (building codes) for housing. The state also uses incentives and sanctions to ensure that residential environments meet minimum standards, and also that market actors are fair in their treatment of housing consumers. In theory, the market supplies housing to meet the demands of housing consumers, and ensures housing stock diversity reflective of the needs of housing consumers. Market actors also serve as gatekeepers to housing opportunities and neighborhoods, which reflect push and pull factors for housing consumers. Households search for and consume housing that balances household needs, budgets, and access to neighborhood resources.\nBed bugs have recently undergone a resurgence and inserted themselves into this system, potentially altering its behavior. Bed bugs cause changes in behavior of governments (policy), markets (rent) and individuals (moves), and in turn, these institutions affect bed bug population dynamics (population growth, dispersal, local extirpation, evolution of dispersal behavior and pesticide resistance). The recent resurgence of bed bugs has caused a range of local policy responses and debates. For instance, New York City is currently implementing disclosure policies that require landlords to notify prospective tenants whether their unit was previously treated for a bedbug infestation. Chicago’s bedbug policies use an escalating fee structure to encourage landlords to treat infestations quickly once they are discovered. In other parts of the country, active policy debate and legislative advocacy is occurring regarding whether bed bug infestations should be considered either the tenant or landlord’s responsibility to treat (Schneider 2019). Related to this debate are broader questions of how bed bug infestations contribute to household precarity and to elevated rates of eviction, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. By treating bed bugs and housing as an integrated social and environmental system, we seek to address several basic yet unanswered questions about the spatial and demographic determinants of bed bug prevalence. We then use the answers to these basic questions to examine how policy interventions may have intended and unintended consequences associated with the types of feedback processes we believe are inherent to this system.\n\n\nFunder\nNational Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center University of Illinois Center for Social and Behavioral Science Chancellor’s Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice\n\n\nPartners\nDr. Alison Hill, Johns Hopkins University Dr. Michael Z.

It questions 1) what unique mixes of government actors are subsidizing housing for low-income individuals; and 2) how well regional Federal Fair Market Rent (FMR) standards align with the incomes of Boston residents, again at the neighborhood level.\nFederal, State, and Local Actors: The Boston region is served by a complex network of affordable housing subsidies, rules, and regulations drawing from federal, state, and local policy. There is a need to understand which programs are serving which neighborhoods, and how the number of subsidized units present at the neighborhood level has changed over time.\nFair Market Rent Standards: The Boston region’s Area Median Income (AMI) guides the rules for setting affordable rents within subsidized and inclusionary housing programs, yet the regional AMI is substantially different from the distribution of incomes at the city and neighborhood level.\nOutputs from this project include an interactive web tool to explore sources of affordable housing at the local level and a tool to explore multiple definitions of housing affordability at the neighborhood level.\n\n\nFunder\nMIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study\n\n\nPartners\nMIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study\n\n\nStaff\nJulia Paiva Emma Walters"

Within the context of urban planning, housing represents one of the ways in which planning intervention has sought to ensure the health and safety of residents, while also bearing influence on the spatial, social, and economic relationships that differentiate housing and other land uses. Within this class, we will explore the policies and practices that constitute housing policy in the United States and abroad, in order to understand where and how planning strategies have been effective (and ineffective) at shaping physical, economic, social, and political dimensions of housing.\nBy the end of this course, we will develop:\n\nAn understanding of the housing production and regulation system in the United States;\nAn understanding of historic and contemporary housing policy intervention strategies;\nAn understanding the intersection between housing policy and other urban policy initiatives;\nA framework for evaluation and analysis of housing policies in the US and abroad;\nStrategies for effective analysis and communication of housing policy trends and impacts.\n\n\n\nFAA 499 / UP 494 Informing the Illinois Arts Ecosystem\nCo-taught with Jennifer Novak-Leonard and Magdalena Novoa\nRegistration Link\nThis special topics-course is a team-led workshop that will engage students with timely matters and challenges affecting arts and artists across the state of Illinois, and with cultural leaders working to address those challenges. A key tool needed and used by such cultural leaders is research and evidence; hence, in addition to being exposed to current matters affecting the arts ecosystem across the state, students will engage with and work toward producing research and evidence that can help inform the work of cultural leaders. Students will participate in two, one-day trips to Chicago to meet with cultural leaders working to address timely matters and challenges in the city and throughout Illinois. Prior background in either arts or policy is not required to participate in the class.\nBy the end of the course we will develop:\n\nA better understanding of who artists and creative workers at in Illinois, where they live, and what some of their main characteristics are.\nA better understanding of the organizations and institutions who are engaging with and addressing issues that overlap with or impact artists and creative workers.\nA detailed understanding of policies directly and indirectly targeting quality of life and stability for artists and creative workers.\nPolicy-informed research that can inform current debates at the local, state, and federal level around issues related to the arts.\n\nHere are some example policy briefs and issues which will guide our learning this semester:\n\nIssue Brief: The Status of Artists and Creative Workers\nIssue Brief: The Artist Labor Force: a statistical look at Illinois in context of the U.S.\nIssue Brief: Housing Affordability for Illinois Artists and Creative Workers (2019–2021)\nPeoria’s Cultural Assets: Mapping Resources, People, and Meaning / Peoria’s Cultural Assets Storymap\n\n\n\nUP 592 Doctoral Urban Planning Seminar\nRegistration Link\nThe Doctoral Urban Planning seminar is a platform for intellectual development for PhD students in the Department of Urban & Regional Planning and a medium for building a community of scholars. The seminars facilitate the exchange of ideas and perspectives among urban planning Ph.D. students and faculty. The seminar is intended to benefit doctoral students across all stages in their research and doctoral studies, and provides a shared space for students to present their research and to solicit critical, yet constructive, peer reviews and advice."
