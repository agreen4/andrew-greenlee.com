## Fall 2023

### FAA 499 / UP 494 Informing the Illinois Arts Ecosystem (with Jennifer Novak-Leonard and Magdalena Novoa)

[Registration Link](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/UP/494)

This special topics-course is a team-led workshop that will engage students with timely matters and challenges affecting arts and artists across the state of Illinois, and with cultural leaders working to address those challenges. A key tool needed and used by such cultural leaders is research and evidence; hence, in addition to being exposed to current matters affecting the arts ecosystem across the state, students will engage with and work toward producing research and evidence that can help inform the work of cultural leaders. Students will participate in two, one-day trips to Chicago (tentatively 9/8/23 and 9/29/23, subject to change) to meet with cultural leaders working to address timely matters and challenges in the city and throughout Illinois.

Techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood and local government scale.

We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will learn how to design primary data collection strategies to fill in gaps in knowledge gained through exploration and analysis of existing data.
